✔️ What is Multer?

Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, 
which is mainly used for uploading files (like images, PDFs, etc.) from a client (browser) to your server.

Express cannot handle file uploads by default, because form-data with files is binary,
 not JSON. Multer parses this form-data and saves the files where you want.

✔️ How Multer Works (Step-by-Step)

1- Client sends a file

Usually via an HTML form or AJAX FormData.

The enctype of the form must be "multipart/form-data".

Multer intercepts the request

It detects fields containing files.

Processes the binary file data.

Multer saves the file

Disk storage → saves the file on your server.

Memory storage → keeps the file in memory as a buffer.

Multer adds metadata

Single file → req.file

Multiple files → req.files

Metadata includes:

filename

path

size

mimetype

Server uses the file

Save path in database.

Resize images.

Respond to the client confirming upload.
