1️⃣ What is Multer?

Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is mainly used for uploading files (like images, PDFs, etc.) from a client (browser) to your server.

Express cannot handle file uploads by default, because form-data with files is binary, not JSON. Multer parses this form-data and saves the files where you want.
