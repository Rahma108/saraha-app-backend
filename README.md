📧 OTP System (Mailtrap)

OTP (One-Time Password) is used for secure email verification and password resets.

🔹 Features:

Generate a random OTP for user verification

Send OTP via email using Mailtrap (SMTP)

Validate OTP within a limited time

Secure handling and storage

🔹 User Model for OTP

Each OTP record contains:

userId – Reference to the user

otp – Hashed OTP code

expiresAt – Expiration time

isUsed – Boolean flag for one-time use 

Mailtrap Configuration
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USER=<your-mailtrap-username>
MAIL_PASS=<your-mailtrap-password>  


🔹 Sample OTP Workflow

User signs up or requests verification

Backend generates a secure OTP

OTP is hashed and saved in the database

OTP is sent via email using Mailtrap

User submits OTP for verification

Backend validates OTP and marks it as used 

🔹 Folder Structure (OTP)
modules/
└── otp/
    ├── otp.model.js       # OTP schema / database model
    ├── otp.controller.js  # Generate & validate OTP
    └── otp.service.js     # Email sending & hashing logic

🔹 Security Measures

OTP hashed before saving

One-time use enforced

Expiration time to prevent reuse 

Token-based Authentication

Secure Credential Update Handling
